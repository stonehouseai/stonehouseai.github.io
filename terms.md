**Terms of Service for Interview Proctor**

**Last Updated:** June 10, 2025

Welcome to Interview Proctor\! These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the Interview Proctor software, which includes the Google Meeting Add-on and the Systray application (collectively, the "Software"), provided by Stonehouse Studio ("we," "us," or "our").

By downloading, installing, accessing, or using the Software, you signify that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use the Software.

**1\. Description of the Software**

Interview Proctor is a software solution designed to facilitate and monitor remote interviews. It consists of two main components:

* **Google Meeting Add-on:** This component integrates with Google Meet and offers two distinct modes:  
  * **Interviewer Mode:** For use by the individual or entity conducting the interview (the "Interviewer") to evaluate a candidate's skills and abilities. In this mode, the Interviewer can view specific information collected from the Candidate's computer (as detailed below) via our backend server.  
  * **Candidate Mode:** For use by the individual participating in the interview (the "Candidate") to demonstrate their skills and abilities. This mode provides instructions for installing the Systray App and facilitates the collection and transmission of information to the Interviewer.  
* **Interview Proctor Agent:** This is a Systray App running on the Candidate's computer. It is initiated through the Google Meeting Add-on by the Candidate. It is responsible for collecting the following information from the Candidate's computer during an active interview session:  
  * Screenshots of the Candidate's screen activity.  
  * Information about running processes on the Candidate's computer.  
  * Basic user information (e.g., operating system username).  
  * Basic hardware information (e.g., operating system type, CPU, RAM). (collectively, "Candidate Data"). This Candidate Data is then securely transferred to our backend server and made accessible in real-time or near real-time to the Interviewer through the Google Meeting Add-on.

**2\. User Roles and Responsibilities**

* **Interviewer:**  
  * Represents the entity or individual conducting the interview and evaluating the Candidate.  
  * Is responsible for obtaining any necessary consents from the Candidate for the collection, processing, and viewing of their Candidate Data through the Software, beyond the consent obtained through the Candidate's acceptance of these Terms. This includes ensuring compliance with all applicable privacy and data protection laws.  
  * Agrees to use the Candidate Data accessed through the Software solely for the legitimate purpose of evaluating the Candidate's suitability for the relevant role or opportunity.  
  * Agrees not to use the Candidate Data for any unlawful, discriminatory, or unauthorized purposes.  
* **Candidate:**  
  * Acknowledges and agrees that by using the Software in Candidate Mode, they consent to the installation of the Systray App on their computer for the duration of the interview.  
  * Acknowledges and expressly consents to the collection of Candidate Data by the Systray App and its transmission to the Interviewer via our backend server, as described in Section 1\.  
  * Is responsible for ensuring they have the necessary permissions and authority to install and run the Systray App on the computer used for the interview.  
  * Is responsible for closing or securing any personal, sensitive, or confidential applications, files, or information on their computer before and during the interview to prevent their inadvertent capture as part of the Candidate Data. We are not responsible for the capture of any such unintended information.

**3\. License to Use the Software**

Subject to your full compliance with these Terms, we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable license to install and use the Software solely for its intended purpose as described herein and in accordance with your designated role (Interviewer or Candidate).

**4\. Data Collection, Privacy, and Security**

* **Data Collected:** As detailed in Section 1, the Software collects Candidate Data.  
* **Purpose of Collection:** Candidate Data is collected and transmitted to the Interviewer to assist in the fair and effective evaluation of the Candidate's skills, abilities, and engagement during an interview.  
* **Data Handling and Transmission:** Candidate Data is transferred from the Candidate's computer to our backend server and then made accessible to the Interviewer. We will implement commercially reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect the security, confidentiality, and integrity of Candidate Data during its transmission and temporary storage (if any) on our servers. However, no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.  
* **Privacy Policy:** Your use of the Software is also governed by our Privacy Policy available at [https://binp.github.io/aiproctor/privacy-policy.html](https://binp.github.io/aiproctor/privacy-policy.html), which is incorporated by reference into these Terms. Please review the Privacy Policy to understand our practices concerning the collection and use of information.  
* **Data Retention:** Candidate Data is primarily intended for real-time viewing by the Interviewer. We will define and adhere to a data retention policy for any Candidate Data that may be temporarily stored on our backend servers, aiming to minimize the storage period. Candidate Data is deleted within 180 days after the interview concludes.

**5\. Consent**

By using the Software in Candidate Mode, the Candidate explicitly:

* Consents to the installation and operation of the Systray App on their computer.  
* Consents to the collection of Candidate Data by the Systray App.  
* Consents to the transmission of Candidate Data to the Interviewer via our backend server.

The Interviewer is responsible for clearly informing the Candidate about the use of Interview Proctor and its data collection functionalities before the interview begins.
